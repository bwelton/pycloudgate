To set up Google Cloud Storage:

install gsutil
https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install

Follow the friendly directions on the above site.  Everything should work
because I made you both editors on the project.

install boto (python library). It is already included inside gsutil, so just
add the folder to PYTHONPATH. Add gsutils path to PYTHONPATH as well.

The unit tests on the google bucket should work now!
